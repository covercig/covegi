## Experimental results for CoVEGI
The results associated with the four research-questions can be obtained here:

### RQ1 & RQ2:
+ For [k-induction as master](evaluation/tabels/rq1/rq1-kind.html)
+ For [predicate abstraction as master](evaluation/tabels/rq1/rq1-kind.html)


### RQ3: 
+ For [k-induction as master](evaluation/tabels/rq4/rq4-kind.html)

### Further information
In the paper, we state that the best value for `timerM` is 50 seconds.
The results validating that claim can be found here:
+ For [k-induction as master](evaluation/tabels/rq3/rq3-kind.html)
